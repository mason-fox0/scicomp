Implementation of various important computational methods in Fortran.

Each method will be generally be explored using 3 steps:
1. My (potentially naive) implementation of the method or algorithm.
2. A benchmark of my implementation as compared to commonly used, optimized versions of the method.
3. A small project involving an application of the method to an interesting problem.

This is a work in progress, but some of the methods I intend to explore are:  
  -Newton's Method  
  -Least Squares  
  -Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel Iterations  
  -Runge-Kutta Integration Methods  
  -Euler's Method  
  -Finite Difference Methods  
  -Markov Chains  
  -FFT  
  -LU and QR Matrix Decomposition  
  -Singular Value Decomposition
